## Abstract
In the face of changing climate, the development of evidence-based and progressive conservation policies depends on robust and quantitative baseline studies to resolve habitat natural variability and rate of change. Despite Antarcticaâ€™s significant role in global climate regulation, climate trend estimates for continental Antarctica are ambiguous due to sparse long-term in-situ records. In Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation serves as a local integrator of environmental change because it is directly and overwhelmingly impacted by climatic conditions. Here, we present the longest, spatially explicit survey of Antarctic vegetation at Cape Hallett by harmonising historic vegetation mapping with modern remote sensing techniques. In the absence of known regional warming, Cape Hallett vegetation is seasonally dynamic and driven by water availability with slow but detectable growth across decades. This unique record allows us to establish a biological sentinel site to track subtle yet impactful environmental variability and change in terrestrial Antarctica in the 21st century.
